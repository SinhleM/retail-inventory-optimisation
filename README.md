<h1>Retail Sales & Inventory Optimization</h1>

<p>
  A complete, locally hosted data engineering pipeline designed to analyze and optimize retail sales and inventory management. 
  The system ingests raw CSV data, processes it through a Python-based ETL workflow, and loads it into a local PostgreSQL data warehouse. 
  The curated data is then visualized in Power BI to provide meaningful insights into sales performance, inventory turnover, and product trends.

<p>
  Built to demonstrate my skills in data pipeline development, database modeling, and business intelligence, this project simulates realistic South African retail data 
  and transforms it into actionable insights for decision-making.
</p>

<h2>Why This Project?</h2>
<p>
  Retail businesses often struggle to efficiently track and analyze sales and stock levels, which can lead to overstocking, stockouts, and missed revenue opportunities. 
  This project solves that problem by providing a structured, automated process for generating, transforming, and visualizing retail data, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making.
</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Generation & ETL:</strong> Python (Pandas, Psycopg2)</li>
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> Local PostgreSQL (managed via PgAdmin)</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Power BI Desktop</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Information</h2>
<p>
  The project generates synthetic retail sales and inventory data that mimics South African market patterns. The ETL script processes the raw CSV files, 
  cleans the data, and loads it into a PostgreSQL data warehouse structured in a star schema for efficient querying. 
  Power BI then connects directly to the warehouse to build interactive dashboards tracking key metrics such as sales trends, 
  product performance, and stock efficiency.
